Project Description

This project is a simple React Authentication App built with React Router DOM. It contains two main components:

Login Page â€“ The default page (at path /) where users can log in.

Register Page â€“ A signup page (at path /Register) where users can create a new account.

The app uses React Router to handle navigation between pages without reloading the browser, making it a smooth Single Page Application (SPA).
